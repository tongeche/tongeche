## Profile

I build data-driven systems that transform operations into measurable intelligence.

My work sits at the intersection of:
- PostgreSQL data modeling  
- Workflow automation  
- API integration  
- Internal analytics platforms  
- Performance-focused system design  

I focus on clarity, structure, and long-term maintainability.
